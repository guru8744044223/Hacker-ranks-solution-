Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If n  is odd, print Weird
If n  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If n  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If n  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints
1<_n<_100

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Explanation 0

n=3
 n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation 1

n=24
n>20 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
